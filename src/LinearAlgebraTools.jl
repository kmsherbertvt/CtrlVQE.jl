function propagator(H::AbstractMatrix, τ::Real)::AbstractMatrix end
    # NOTE: A bit much physics for a `LinearAlgebraTools` module. Maybe `ComputeBox` is more semantic. Anyway, this method should use cached temp arrays with eigen! to efficiently take exp(-𝑖τH). In fact it just creates the new matrix -𝑖τH, calls exponentiate!, and returns the result.

function rotate!(U::AbstractMatrix, ψ::AbstractVector)::AbstractVector end
    # NOTE: mutates and returns ψ
function rotate!(U::AbstractMatrix, A::AbstractMatrix)::AbstractMatrix end
    # NOTE: mutates and returns A
    # NOTE: These two should exploit diagonal nature if Diagonal is passed as U. Verify.
function rotate!(u::AbstractVector{<:AbstractMatrix}, ψ::AbstractVector)::AbstractVector end
    # NOTE: This method is a tensorapply, assuming each u acts on a single body of ψ. I don't know offhand how to write it when bodies aren't necessarily the same size; I might have to impose each single body is equal size for sensible pre-allocation? That would be annoying.

    # NOTE: we could write tensorapply on a matrix, but I don't _think_ we will want it anymore? Wanted it before for ligand operator, but I don't think we lose much by leaving single-body operations for the drive phase.

function compose(U1::AbstractMatrix, U2::AbstractMatrix)::AbstractMatrix end
    # NOTE: Just a semantic way of saying U1 * U2, permitting LAT optimizations if we deem it appropriate. But, pre-allocation doesn't help here since we have to return a new array... Might get rid of this.
